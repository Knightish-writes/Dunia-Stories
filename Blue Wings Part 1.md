# Blue Wings (Part 1)

The older celestials used to tell Blue Wings that they were crafted by the gods to be servants of the divine. There was a glory in their purpose. Angels used to be the divine messengers of all the gods. They carried their word across the land in a never-ending song. Their skin was alabaster and their cloaks made of the clouds. They fashioned themselves great leaders and great teachers. They walked the mortal through his own journey. They fought devils and demons alike to protect the lost souls. The celestials of old cared for justice.

During the first god war, they were greater still. They worked with Hisia to seal the other gods away in the Ginnungagap. They found peace in a world with none. Two hundred years of peace followed, the angels protecting the walls of Elysium from fiends. They were soldiers in an endless battle with evil. During the second god war, the angels mediated the battles of all the gods. When Sitholos drew victory with the tip of his spear, they cheered. When he turned it on himself, they cried.

Blue Wings pondered all of this when slapping clay to a small building, filling the cracks in it. After the death of all the gods, the elemental and upper planes bled into one another. This was the only world Blue Wings had known. This was Crown.

In the old days, angels were crafted by the gods. With no gods, Blue Wings was crafted with the clay created when the plane of water crashed on the shores of Old Elysium. The same clay she used now to finish this building was used to make her. She felt her jaw tighten at the thought of it.

Wiping the clay onto the building, suddenly Blue Wings heard a cry. Someone was asking for her help on the plane below, the material plane. It was an odd thing, people didn’t pray often in those times.

“Save us! A devil is chasing us!” The voice loudly shot to Blue Wings’ ears. It seemed to not care for the laws of Crown, penetrating the barrier between planes. Fate was never one to care for laws. She felt drawn to the voice and looked down toward the material plane. It was a man, thin and pallid, wearing nothing more than sackcloth. The fiend chasing was thin, baring its silver teeth, wielding a large spear, and burning the grass to ash with every step.

Blue Wings had been told growing up that it was imperative to never involve herself with mortal affairs. Elysium needed to be rebuilt, after all. When her eyes fell on the mortal affairs of this man and the fiend though, she felt an ancient need to act in the face of danger. A desire grew within her to slay evil. A resolution to bring justice upon sinners.

The man had tripped and fell, rolling down a hill. The fiend followed with a mighty leap. He looked at the man with eyes of red. Keeping his dagger-like tongue a secret for later. The man’s face was full of sweat, dirt, and tears. It was only when seeing the face of his victim that the devil was finally willing to flay his body before killing him and hanging him on a tree near his manor. As the devil lifted its spear, it heard someone else coming from the clouds.

Blue Wings had never fought before and fashioned a sword from the clay meant to fix a home. Her grip tightening on the handle. She was afraid, afraid that the light of heaven would not be strong enough to purge the sinner. A deeper, calmer voice pierced through the veil of anxiety and concern. Someone had asked for her help, it was wrong to deny the request.

“I ask forgiveness from the old gods, though they may be dead. Forgiveness from my father. Forgiveness from my clan. I pray forgiveness for the violence I am about to inflict!” The voice shone like the sun. The devil saw her then, a woman as beautiful as death with hair like fire and eyes like emeralds. She dove towards him, a glint of light, brighter than the sun. The devil felt the most base urge in all living creatures, fear. A sword fashioned from the clay of Elysium came at him. His attacker ensuring the sword cut him at the ribs.

The devil fell, cut in twain and all of Crown watched as an angel made contact with men for the first time in over a century.
