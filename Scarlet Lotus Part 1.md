# Scarlet Lotus (Part 1)

The office was warm, everywhere was on Throne. One could hear the turning wheel of society just outside the walls of this small office. Inside the office was a fiend like any other, a devil. Born for bureaucracy the devils were the most organized, unlike their demon kin. Although, that barely mattered anymore. Throne had brought together all the fiends into one pile. It did not matter that the fiends were at one time very harsh enemies, it only mattered now that the fiends were forced to work together. The devil thought of this as a lost past, never to be regained. He swiftly went back to work, as all devils do. Reading through contracts and trying to find their loopholes and oddities. He was a tall devil, with musculature that would put even the strongest athletes to shame. He had blood red skin and long, sharp horns. At his desk were large sheets of paper, pens, and a glaive made of cold iron. He was a studious sort of devil, finishing all of his contract reviews for the day he stood from his desk and resigned to leaving the office.

Upon his exit, he ran into a friend of his, Azpetia, a Phistophilus. She strode next to him, “Dangerous for you to be doing contract work, don’tcha think?” Her voice was saccharine sweet and had a silky quality that lured mortals into contracts with her. She was a good devil.

“We’re all skilled in contracts,” he replied. He started to look up at the darkness of the sky in Throne. It was an utterly boring thing to see. “Besides, most of the best work done isn’t here. It’s there.” His long, clawed finger pointed up past Throne and toward the material plane. Azpetia nodded.

“True, but it’s not exactly safe to go there now,” she sighed. “Some angel decided to defy Crown and Council to fight us up there.” This was news to the devil, angels never came down to fight fiends. Azpetia continued. “They’ve been calling her Blue Wings or something. She’s been helping the people up there from us. She’s killed hundreds in the past decade.” He stopped walking.

“What’s the matter? Is the mighty Scarlet Lotus scared?” She joked.

“No, I believe I’ve found a chance to leave the contract work behind.” Scarlet Lotus ran off in a direction Azpetia could not follow. It was then he made a resolution to kill Blue Wings.

There was a small cave off the edge of Concord. Unbeknownst to most people, the cave let one slip into Throne. There were few people who would be willing to go to Throne anyway, but among the few who were willing there were DIVERS, people who went searching for treasure and information in Throne. DIVERS wore standardized uniforms and the elite among them, the Buried, wielded silver swords blessed with holy magic, a rare commodity indeed. Diving was a dangerous activity, but today seemed like any other dangerous day heading down to Throne. The cave was slick with moisture caused by a recent changing of seasons. A diving team carefully crawled its way to a gaping maw in the floor of the cave. An ancient hum yawned its way out of the maw.

One of the divers, the most experienced, took out a small torch and began motioning for one of the others to hop down first. He did as he was told and fell into the darkness. The leader then gestured for the next to drop. This continued until the leader gestured for the least experienced to drop next.

“I’m sorry.” The voice trembled out of the inexperienced diver. “I don’t think I can do this.” The young man was trembling.

“Nonsense,” said the leader. “We’ve got your back here.” He gave the kid a solid slap on the back and pushed him into the maw. It was the same way he was taught, one only needed to step into the abyss and accept what one finds.

He took a deep breath and prepared for the dive himself. As he looked into the maw, he saw the youngest hung in the air, his body limp. The air was sucked out of his lungs as he looked desperately to see what happened. The body started rise from the abyss, it was then the glint of a cold iron glaive started to rise with it. A devil three men tall and four men wide emerged from the deep. The heads of all the previous divers lay strung on his hip. His black horns stained with blood. The towering devil looked at the man with red eyes, burning with fury. The devil leaned down and hissed.

“You live for one purpose, mortal.” The devil pulled the young man from the glaive tearing his body in two. “Find Blue Wings for me. Tell her that Scarlet Lotus will kill her precious mortals until she dies by my hand. Do you understand?” The Diver nodded. “Good.” Scarlet Lotus floated back down to Throne, smiling to himself.

When Blue Wings had heard of Scarlet Lotus killing mortals, she found herself too busy with other devils of different contracts doing much the same. She had lived in the mortal realm for nearly eighty years and there was still much to do. She resolved to take on a few pupils to help with the fight against Scarlet Lotus. The group of women became known as mighty swordmasters throughout the continent. They were called The Winged Maidens. They were forty in number at the end. Hand-trained in fiend-killing arts by Blue Wings they each had a strength not found in any mortal since.

Of these maidens was Eloise Esmira. She had dark skin and wielded a marble-white blade and a golden shield. She was the strongest of all the Winged Maidens, born as the first daughter on the first day of the year under a new moon. Eloise had learned three of the five master cutting arts before she reached maturity. She had learned four of the five before being set on by Blue Wings to complete a mission to kill Scarlet Lotus.
