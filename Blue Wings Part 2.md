# Blue Wings (Part 2)

The door for the celestial court had a gold filigree which drew an image of a tree expanding out into the cosmos. Blue Wings recognized its meaning, the celestials were meant to bring their message of life to the whole world. She stood quietly in the dark hall, staring at the door as though it held a secret that could be found through the act of staring. The clay sword on her hip felt heavy.

The marble halls were quiet in the court. Blue Wings heard tale of the old denizens filling these halls. They each had a place to be heard and understood here. Now, there was only her standing there contemplating the events of the previous day.

After saving the man who was chased by the devil, the angels requested her appearance. They said she violated a rule and had sent the world into unprecedented times. She was in trouble. She feared the other angels more than any devil in that marble hall. Alone, she only felt the drafts of the broken building and the weight of the clay sword on her hip.

The door opened, a creature with seventy times seven wings each with an eye to call its own, spoke to Blue Wings in a voice that seemed to emanate from the feathers.

“The time has come for judgment, child.” The voice was low and commanding, filling the once empty halls with a low boom. Blue Wings could feel herself trembling, but nodded and stepped forward. Blue Wings was created by the clay of Crown, she was larger than many of the other angels. She didn’t know this. The council of angels sat above her in a single group. She felt quite small.

Each of the angels had something unique about them. Some looked human, like Blue Wings, some looked alien, like the one with eyes in its wings, and some could not be looked at for too long. She stood at a marble and gold podium at the bottom of the room. Each of the angels sat in a semicircle in chairs brought up much higher than the podium. She wondered about lions then.

“Full name?” The voice of one of the councilors felt like a strong wind in her face.

“Blue Wings that Bring the Dawn.” Her full name was given to her by her crafter. An angel named “Red Hammer that Strikes and Heats.” There were some angels who felt their names restricted them, forcing them to play out the meaning. Other angels thought that angels grew to fit their names and are not restricted by them in any real way. Names were a divine thing.

“Please recite the angels vow, so we may begin.” The councilor seemed preoccupied by a set of papers in front of him. Blue Wings had no doubt that they were hers. The vow was a ritual where an angel had to recite what they thought their purpose was in Crown. It was used in times of joy and reprimand. This was the latter.

Blue Wings took a deep breath. “The nature of an angel is a continuous cutting motion.” The council already seemed perplexed by this declaration. Some of the members took a moment to talk to each other while the leader simply glared in the direction of Blue Wings. She felt their eyes judging her. She wondered what their answers would have been at that time. The thought was dashed away by the head councilor speaking.

“You made contact with a mortal, this was forbidden after the death of Sitholos. Could you explain your thought process to us?” Blue Wings knew she was about to reprimanded for what she had done. She knew that Crown would struggle to find peace with an angel that broke laws. She was a bad angel. It didn’t help matters that she was fashioned from clay, while the remaining angels were made by the hands of a god. She was an outsider to them forever. They would never see her as a true angel.

“I heard the cries of the man, his name was Cedrick. I dove to fight evil and save the innocent. Is that not what you did in the ancient days?” Blue Wings had a beautiful and stern voice, though she did not know it. Her eyes seared with accusation. Streams of blue flame rushed from her eyes and filled the well with two streaks of light. She had the image of a warrior with great power. The council was left agape at the demonstration. A member managed to speak through the shock.

“We don’t do that anymore!” His voice was old and tired. “We need to focus on the rebuilding of our home, the mortals have short lives, keeping them on for an extra few decades takes more time than it is worth.” The other councilors nodded. The angel that spoke was one from before even the first god war. His visage was that of an animal with a large snout and sharp ears, his body was that of a man’s. Blue Wings could feel a pain grow in her stomach, something subtle and off. She was upset.

“Our job is not to calculate the amount of years of utility the people bring!” She slammed her fist against the podium and pointed at the old angel. “In the old days we served mortals with whole hearts, with whole kindness. It’s shameful to hear your generation cast them aside like rocks in soup.” She realized then, she was tall, her voice was strong, her sword was heavy and she was the only one wielding it.

“I don’t need any of you!” She moved out of the council chamber. “The mortals below are suffering beyond your understanding. I _will_ help them. I’ll defeat vile demons, sneaky devils, and if you halt my progress in such things, I will remind you of what I think of the nature of angels!” She leapt down to the material plane, leaving the councilors to their own devices. The sword laying heavy on her hip.
